Analyze the current UI Composition in #File:Accounts.vue file.

Based on the model in #File:Account, #File:Transaction, #Folder:Models, I want to implement some create, update, and delete features for the following data:
1. Transaction data with table components in #Folder:table with pagination and limit
2. Create transaction from the button above the table like in #File:Budget.vue, after click, it will pop up some dialog that the user needs to fill in the form and submit it.
3. Edit transaction from the table with the same dialog mechanism
4. Delete transaction from the table with alert dialog confirmation #Folder:alert-dialog
5. Use select for the account_id and category_id selection, account_id is a must but category_id can be null

For this specific request, what solution can you suggest and do it!


Analyze the current UI Composition in #File:Accounts.vue file.

Based on the current UI, there is a lot of problems including:
1. The table is rendered all of the transactions, add some pagination and limit by analyzing #File:AccountController.php
2. A lot of issues with the dialog component being used here, including:
a. The dialog is not closed when clicked outside the dialog
b. The dialog is rendered multiple? idk?
c. Other issue you need to check the #Docs
3. Change the 'add transaction' button into left analyzing
4. the page is not in bahasa indonesia, translate the content into bahasa indonesia!
5. The date input picker is not using date picker from shadcn-vue #Docs
6. I can't click the account and category select component

Fix the issues step by step
