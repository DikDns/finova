Analyze the current UI Composition in #File:Budget.vue file.

Based on the model in #Folder:Models, I want to implement some create, update, and delete features for the following data:
1. Create a new group category which should utilize the 'Tambah Kategori' button.
2. Create a new category inside the group category
3. Edit group category name
4. Edit category name
5. Delete group category
6. Delete category
7. Edit allocated amount to the category
8. Edit available (in indonesia it's on purpose name 'target' column) amount to the category
9. Add new monthly_budget to the budget when the user click the next/previous month button that doesn't have monthly_budget with the initial value of allocated same as previous/next (depending on the button click) month for all categories
