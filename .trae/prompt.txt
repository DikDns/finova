Analyze the current UI Composition in #File:Budget.vue file.

Based on the model in #Folder:Models, I want to implement some create, update, and delete features for the following data:
1. Edit allocated amount to the category
2. Edit available (in indonesia it's on purpose name 'target' column) amount to the category
3. Add new monthly_budget to the budget when the user click the next/previous month button that doesn't have monthly_budget with the initial value of allocated same as previous/next (depending on the button click) month for all categories

For this specific request, what solution can you suggest and provide for the desktop layout?
Explains the pros and cons!
Do you have any alternatives?

Don't apply any changes to the current UI composition.
